After checking out the sources, to start the dev server: ant runserver

To run unit-tests: ant unit-tests

To run javascript unit tests: ant js-unit-tests

To run selenium functional tests:
- ant deletedb (delete the database)
- ant runserver
- ant selenium-tests

TODO/Known issues:
- upgrade to Spring 3.0 for REST support.
- need more functional tests
- fix functional tests target to automatically start the dev server with a clean datastore.
- spatial search is a problem because of google appengine limitation where
only one inequality filter per query is supported.
GeoHash approach does not work accurately (http://labs.metacarta.com/blog/27.entry/geographic-queries-on-google-app-engine/
 and http://public.grupoinnovant.com/blog/?p=23).
Current approach searches by lat and then filters in memory - won't scale.
- Issue with using GAE transactions with Compass due to the fact that the GAE store will not
allow transactions involving more than 1 entity group. This is why saving EnvHazard
is not stored in transaction.
